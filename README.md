✨ Highlights:

Parallel Execution: Leveraged Jenkins for scalable test execution across multiple environments.

Dynamic Data Generation: Used utilities to create random test data (e.g., names, prices, dates).

Comprehensive Coverage: From token creation to booking management, every critical API flow was tested.

Detailed Reporting: Allure Report provided actionable insights into test results, failures, and trends.

🌐 Why This Matters:
This project showcases a robust API automation framework capable of handling complex workflows for a booking system. By combining Playwright's powerful testing capabilities with Jenkins for CI/CD and Allure for reporting, we achieved scalable, reliable, and efficient test execution. This ensures the API's functionality, reliability, and performance across various scenarios, ultimately delivering a high-quality product to end-users.
